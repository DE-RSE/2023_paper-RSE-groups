                The association of german RSEs, de-RSE e.V., is currently writing a position paper on
                establishing RSE departments in research institutions. The paper aims to convince local
                decision makers of the value of dedicated RSE departments and should provide blueprints
                for such departments. In the process of writing we realized that existing RSE departments
                across the globe differ quite a bit w.r.t. the services they offer and the working areas
                they put special focus on. Another important observation was that RSE work can typically
                be either done by a central RSE institution or by more narrowly-focussed, domain-specific
                RSEs that are embedded into a network of RSEs. We use the terms hub (central) and spokes
                (decentral) for these. We would be very greatful for feedback about your RSE department.
                To participate, just fill the fields below and adjust the weights of the RSE task areas
                below. The "Centralization" field means: How much of this work happens at the "hub"
                (higher number, more centralized), how much at the spokes? Do not forget to hit submit
                after filling the form in.
