    "institution_text": "I have filled out the fields to the best of my knowledge, on behalf of our Head of RSE. I have answered the \"SW Development\" section based on provision of SW development to research groups via our \"postdoc pool\" arrangement (see https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-software-engineering/software-howtos/how-to-fund-software/). In this setup, RSEs are costed onto grant-funded projects as specialist researchers and embedded with research teams. At the end of work on a project, they can be redeployed to another gran-funded project. The SW development service is therefore \"bookable\" with the granularity of research grants.",
